# Cyber Security Base â€“ Project 1

In this project I used the OWASP Top ten 2021 list of Applicaion Security Risks, provided in thw webpage: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/.Also used the CSFR security risk, tho it is not specified in the OWASP Top ten 2021 list.

The website is implemented using Pyhton and Django. The base was created using the instructions of the Django starter website: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/, however from there the website has been largely modified.

# Cyber Security Base â€“ Project 1

This is a project where I constructed a software with security flaws, pointed them out and provided steps to fix them.

In this project I used the OWASP Top ten 2021 list of Applicaion Security Risks, provided in the webpage: https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/.Also used the CSFR security risk, tho it is not specified in the OWASP Top ten 2021 list.

The website is implemented using Pyhton and Django. The base was created using the instructions of the Django starter website: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/, however from there the website has been largely modified.
